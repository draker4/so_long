# so_long
5th project of my 42 cursus. so_long is a 2D platform game using the minilibx graphics library, with collisions, ennemies and collectibles.
It's a minigame where the player can move, jump, collect diamonds, attack ennemies, win or die, using text files as map with only 0 and 1 characters (1 for walls, 0 for background).
This project comply with the MacOs minilibx library.
